    		<p> Summer of 2019 I had the opportunity to intern at Palo Alto Networks in their stunning Santa Clara headquarters. I was a UX/UI intern in the Customer Experience Department.</p>

            	<p id = "section-title">WHAT I DID</p>
            	<p>I worked on consumer facing project of designing the customer support portal for both internal customer support employees and Palo Alto Networks customers. I worked closely with a PM and a handful of engineers to improve the usability and effectiveness of PAN&apos;s customer support portal and to decrease the number of tickets being open.</p>

            	<p id = "section-title">MAIN LEARNINGS</p>
            	<p>From working cross-functionally with others, I learned how to prioritize ideas and how to approach engineering contraints, finding it especially helpful to hold workshops to do so early on. I was also able to conduct internal interviews with security operations services users and sales engineers, learning that a lot of invaluable insights can be gained regardless of whether or not you have direct access to customers.</p>

            	<p><span style = "font-style: italic">&quot;Janet worked on my team at Palo Alto Networks in the summer of 2019 as a Digital Experience Design Intern. The main project she focused on involved implementing an online user experience for our Customer Support Department that leveraged experimental machine learning and artificial intelligence to deliver recommendations to customers who were having problems with the company&apos;s products. It was a big ask for an intern as it was a very important project with visibility up to the C-level. She did not hesitate to step up and as a result, to date, the interaction that she developed has saved the company money in the six figures. There are many great things to say about working with Janet, but I think her drive to step up stands out the most. With each successive one-on-one it seemed that she found a few more projects to put on her plate.&quot;</span>
