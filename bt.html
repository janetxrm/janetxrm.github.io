			            	<p>We followed a task based user testing protocol with 10 students and tested workflows for the following three pages: </p>
			            	<li> 1. Course catalog </li>
			            	<br>
							<li> 2. Grade distributions</li>
							<br>
				  			<li> 3. Enrollment </li>
				  			<p> &nbsp; </p>

			            	<p>In our first round of user testing, users were presented with a course catalog that had a side menu for setting filters. Activated filters would then be displayed as pills on the original course catalog screen.</p>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<img id = "content-img" src = "assets/og course cat.png"/>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>		            	
			            	<p> We witnessed participants run into several usability issues with the previous flow, so we explored different mobile patterns that led to the following flow:</p>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<img id = "content-img" src = "assets/final course cat.png"/>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<p> Moving forward with the grade distrubutions screen, usability testing allowed us to spot where existing patterns used on the desktop interface failed when they were translated to mobile. This was especially prevalent in data visualizations; users found it difficult to interact with graphs and to interpret screens that were text and statistics heavy.</p>
			            	<p> Below is the evolution of the grade distribution screen as we learned from these observations:</p>
