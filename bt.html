In this project, I worked with a web engineer and another designer to make the site compatible across all devices. </p>

			            	<h1>Problem</h1>
			            	<p><span>Choosing classes at UC Berkeley is a time-consuming and frustrating process.</span> This is due to many factors students face, some of which include frustratingly long waitlists, a lack of grading transparency, and a lot of pressure choosing the right classes to graduate on time.</p>
							<p>As a team of student volunteers, our mandate was simple for this project: do whatever we can to <span>simplify the course discovery process.</span></p>

			            	<h1>Research</h1>
			            	<p>We started off with a generative research study, interviewing current Berkeley students and learning more about their experiences choosing and enrolling for classes. </p>

			            	<h1>Goal</h1>
			            	<p>My goal in particular was to scale the interaction patterns to non desktop platforms to make Berkeleytime accessible across all devices. </p>
			            	<p><span>Priority metrics and KPI&#39;s:</span> Daily active users and mobile website retention rate compared to that of the desktop site.</p>

			            <section id= "Iterations &#38; User Testing">
			            	<h1>Iterations &#38; User Testing</h1>
			            	<p>We followed a task based user testing protocol with 10 students and tested workflows for the following three pages: </p>
			            	<li> 1. Course catalog </li>
							<li> 2. Grade distributions</li>
				  			<li> 3. Enrollment </li>
				  			<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<p>In our first round of user testing, users were presented with a course catalog that had a side menu for setting filters. Activated filters would then be displayed as pills on the original course catalog screen.</p>
			            	<img src = "assets/og course cat.png"/>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<p> We witnessed participants run into several usability issues with the previous flow, so we explored different mobile patterns that led to the following flow:</p>
			            	<img src = "assets/final course cat.png"/>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<p> Moving forward with the grade distrubutions screen, usability testing allowed us to spot <span>where existing patterns used on the desktop interface failed when they were translated to mobile.</span> This was especially prevalent in data visualizations; users found it difficult to interact with graphs and to interpret screens that were text and statistics heavy.</p>
			            	<p> Below is the evolution of the grade distribution screen as we learned from these observations:</p>
			            	<img src = "assets/grade evol.png"/>
			            	<p> &nbsp; </p>
			            	<p>The evolution of the course enrollment screen was similar to that of the grade distributions screen as users faced similar issues.</p>
